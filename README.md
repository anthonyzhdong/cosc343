## Course Description

This paper explores different definitions of intelligence and the concept of intelligent agents, focusing on how to gather and utilize information about the world. We will cover techniques for machine learning and probabilistic reasoning, examining how human learning processes can be modeled computationally.

### Topics Covered

- Search and optimization algorithms (including genetic algorithms)
- Probabilistic reasoning methods (including Bayesian methods)
- Machine learning algorithms (with a focus on neural networks)

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this paper, students should:

1. Understand fundamental concepts of classical AI methods
2. Appreciate challenges in developing robust AI for real-world applications
3. Have a fundamental understanding of various AI methods and their applicability
4. Implement basic algorithms on toy examples (games, spam filters, image recognition)
5. Become proficient with basic machine learning libraries (Python + sklearn)
6. Develop awareness of ethical issues related to AI in everyday life

## Course Structure

The course is structured over 13 weeks, covering various topics in AI. Please refer to the detailed lecture/lab schedule in the course outline.

## Labs

Laboratory exercises provide hands-on experience with implementing AI methods. All programming will be done in Python using VSCode with Anaconda virtual environment.

## Course Readings

**Prescribed Textbook:** Stuart J. Russel, Peter Norvig, "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" (2020), 4th edition, Pearson, Boston.

## Course Administration

The paper will be administered through Blackboard.

## Workload Expectations

Total workload: 180 hours
- Lectures: 26 hours
- Labs: 26 hours
- Studies/Reading: 48 hours
- Assignments: 80 hours

## Assessment

1. Assignment 1 (20%) - Due Week 5
2. Assignment 2 (20%) - Due Week 9
3. Final Exam (60%)

### Assignment Details

- **Assignment 1:** Implement a search-based agent for a simple task/game
- **Assignment 2:** Implement a reinforcement learning agent for a simple task/game

Both assignments require implementation in Python, evaluation of the agent, and a technical report.

## Submission Guidelines

- All assignments must be submitted electronically via Blackboard
- Late submissions incur a 5% penalty per day (including weekends)
- Extensions must be requested before the due date

## Academic Integrity

Students are expected to adhere to the University's Academic Integrity Policy. Use of generative software (e.g., ChatGPT) is considered academic misconduct unless specifically allowed in the assignment.
